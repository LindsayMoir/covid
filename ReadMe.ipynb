    "It can be difficult to get accurate  and time sensitive information on how countries are doing at present during the SARS-2 pandemic (COVID-19 is the illness, the pandemic is the virus).  Exploring factors potentially related to outcomes is important as a means to consider further outcome prediction.  Key factors are likely related to government and public health leadership and the potential for actual public adoption of mitigation strategies for the virus. In this post, I answer 4 questions that should provide some insight into this very important issue. \n",

    "Update the John Hopkins, Covid-19 data https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 by refreshing your local copy of the GitHub repository. Please point this notebook to your local repository of that data. For your convenience this GitHub repository does include the data frozen as of a certain date. The ARIMA model has been hyper parameter tuned, stored on disk and is ready to go. There is a forecasting module that can be ran at any time. It remains to be seen whether or not its predictions will be accurate. \n",

Jason provides code with this book that he explicitly tells you to use and make your own. \n",
